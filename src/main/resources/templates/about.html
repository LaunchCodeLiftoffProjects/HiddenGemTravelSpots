    <h2> Hidden Gems Travel App </h2>

    <p>     We are developing Hidden Gems Travel App to help you find off-the-beaten-path tourist destinations that fit your needs and location. </p>
    <p>     We here at QuaraTeam find that when traveling we desire to see the lesser known parts of the world. </p>
    <p>     Hidden Gems searches for sights and experiences that fit your needs. </p>
    <p>     Our filtering based on activity type, age/family friendliness, accessibility and cost filters.</p>
    <p>     You can also befriend other users on the platform to stay on top of their latest and greatest adventures. </p>
    <p>     Be sure you will find the best and most relevant travel activities every time you log in to our app. </p>
