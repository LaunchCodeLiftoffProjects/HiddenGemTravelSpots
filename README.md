# Hidden Gems Travel App
We are developing Hidden Gems Travel App to help you find off-the-beaten-path tourist destinations that fit your needs and location. We here at QuaranTeam find that when traveling we desire to see the lesser known parts of the world.  If we're in New York we want to see the now-renovated fancy bar that once housed a legendary night club - not the Statue of Liberty!  We want to find that great hiking trail near our motel in Peoria, not the fastest route to Navy Pier.  Hidden Gems brings those experiences to your fingertips.

Hidden Gems searches near your location for user-submitted sights and experiences that fit your needs.  With filtering based on activity type, age/family friendliness, accessibility and cost filters you can be sure you will find the best and most relevant travel activities every time you log in to our app.  You can also befriend other users on the platform to stay on top of their latest and greatest adventures.

### Technologies
Hidden Gems Travel App uses:
* Java 15
* MySQL
* Spring Boot
* Thymeleaf
* Hibernate
* Bootstrap
* Bing Maps API

### What I'll Have to Learn
To complete this project we will need to combine both soft and hard skills in order to build a CRUD app from the ground up. We will learn how to collaborate and communicate effectively in order to hit our milestones, which will involve SCRUM practices, solid communication, and lots of discipline. On the technical end, we will learn how to integrate the Bing Maps API to use in a search function. Lastly, we will practice reading and working with each other's code in order to combine several features into one smooth operation.
